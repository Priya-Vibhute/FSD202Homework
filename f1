Web based learning is often called online learning or e-learning because it includes online course content. Discussion forums via email, videoconferencing, and live lectures (videostreaming) are all possible through the web. Web based courses may also provide static pages such as printed course materials.

Examples include webinars, online meetings, teleconferencing, and online tutoring.

Similarly, while eLearning does not require teachers and students to be online at the same time, lessons during online learning are conducted in real-time.
